# Space Travellers' Hub
> In this task, we worked with the real live data from the SpaceX API. We built a web application for a company that provides commercial and scientific space travel services. The application allows users to book rockets and join selected space missions.

* @Toliboff worked on the Rockets section of this project
* @Ghiftee worked on the Missions section of this project

Each branch on this project was created from the dev branch and they represent a card on the Kanban board. After working on each card/branch(excluding the set-up branch which we worked on together), we reviewed each other's codes and did not begin work on the next card/branch until our pull request was approved.
